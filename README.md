# Tideland Wozzot

## Description

*Tideland Wozzot* is a system for moderated conversations like
discussions or the answerings of questions. If wanted each thread
can have a collaborated result which is developed during the 
conversation. Only invited users can participate but conversations
may be opened to everyone for reading and optionally for voting too. 

Content, tags, and votings for conversations are analyzed in the
background. The results are used individually for each user to
provide a dashboard as entry. This way they don't only get a
better overview over their current conversations but also get
hints for other conversations which may interest them. The users
then may ask moderators to participate.

I hope you like it. ;)
